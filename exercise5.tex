	\subsection{Example}
	In this example,we show how subsections and subsubsubsections are produced(there are no subsubsections).Note how the subsections are numbered.
	\subsubsection{Subexample}
	Did you note that subsubsections are not numbered?This is so in the \texttt{book} and \texttt{report} classes.In the\texttt{article} class they too have numbers.(can you figure out why?)
	\paragraph{note}
	Paragraphs and subparagraphs do not have numbers.and they have
	\textit{run-in} headings.
	Though named "paragraph" we can have several paragraphs of text within this.
	\subparagraph{Subnote}
	subparagraphs have an additional indentataion too.
	And they can also contain more than one paragraph of text.
